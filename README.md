# Data schema 

## Guidelines 

- For every field you should specify the fieldname, datatype and a description in a syntax like 
 
```
temperature (number, K): temperature at which the measurement was performed
```

This syntax is readble and still allows us to convert the schema with minimal effort into a JSON Schema.

- The unit that is specified here, should be the SI unit that is appropiate for this datatype
- The table of contents in this `README` will be generated automatically with a GitHub actions.
